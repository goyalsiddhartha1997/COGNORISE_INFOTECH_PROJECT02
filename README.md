 📰 Fake News Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify news as either "Fake" or "Real." Using machine learning algorithms and a dataset featuring both real and fake news articles, this project addresses the growing need for combating misinformation in media. The model leverages text data from the news articles to detect patterns indicative of misinformation.

 Project Overview 📚

With the widespread accessibility of news on digital platforms, the proliferation of fake news has become a critical issue. The Fake News Prediction project is designed to support efforts in enhancing information integrity and promoting media literacy. By analyzing the textual content of news articles, this model attempts to differentiate between real and fake news based on patterns in the data.

 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:
- Title: The title of the news article.
- Text: The main content of the news article.
- Label: The target variable indicating if the news is "Fake" or "Real."

This data provides a basis for machine learning modeling to help identify misinformation.

 Project Structure 🏗️

 1. Data Loading and Exploration 🔍
- Load and inspect the dataset.
- Understand the data distribution for "Fake" and "Real" news.

 2. Data Preprocessing 🧹
- Clean text data by removing special characters and converting text to lowercase.
- Vectorize the text data using a bag-of-words approach (CountVectorizer) for numerical representation.

 3. Model Training 🤖
- Train a Logistic Regression model to classify the news articles.
- Experiment with different hyperparameters to improve accuracy.

 4. Model Evaluation 📏
- Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualize results with a confusion matrix and other relevant graphs.

 5. Visualization 📈
- Plot the confusion matrix to observe true vs. predicted values.
- Generate Precision-Recall and ROC curves to assess model effectiveness.

 Results 📋

- Accuracy: The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 91.6%.
- Performance Metrics: The model’s high precision and recall scores indicate it can reliably distinguish between real and fake news.
- Feature Importance: Analysis of top features highlights key words that strongly indicate real or fake news, providing insight into patterns within fake news articles.
